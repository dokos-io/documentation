# V1.0.0

:tada: Read the release [blog post](https://dokos.io/en/blog/dokos-new-open-source-erp) :tada:

Dodock v1.0.0 is based on Frappe v12.x.x
Below are the main differences with Frappe.

- The user interface has been enhanced with a few major changes:
    * The desk is now a big dashboard on which you can pin three types of elements: calendars, charts and cards
        1. Calendars are fetching events for all doctypes with a "Calendar view"
        2. Charts can be created in the doctype "Dashboard Chart" on any doctype or via custom scripts in a custom application
        3. Cards can be created in the doctype "Dashboard Card" on any doctype or via custom scripts in a custom application
    * The modules are now accessible via a sidebar
    * Modules details (doctypes/pages/reports) can be found by clicking on the corresponding module in the sidebar
    * Each module can have its own dashboard
    * The user interface is now full-screen by default
    * The desk is also less accessible on mobiles for now. The current decision is to optimize it for tablets and computer displays.

- DocTypes can now be named after submission (Useful for Sales invoices for example. See above.)
- DocTypes can now be sealed:
    * They are integrated in a chained log, thus guaranteeing that they cannot be removed from the system without notice.
    * It replaces the Translation log document type
- DocTypes prints can now be tracked: the first print timestamp is registered in the database, and all further prints can be labelled as duplicates.
- The translation system has been refactored:
    * Translations are now file dependant, thus reducing the risk of translations collisions in some languages.
    * The translation file format is now JSON
- Stripe integration is now only available in dokos
- Multiple portal design enhancements
